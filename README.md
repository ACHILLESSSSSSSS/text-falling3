# Text FallüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Eldhose George


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Name] - Viswajyothi college of engineering and technology
### Project Description
TextFall is an interactive web experience where users can type any text and watch it elegantly fall from the top of the screen under simulated gravity. The words bounce softly upon hitting the floor, then spectacularly explode into colorful, glowing letter fragments that scatter and fade away, creating a visually captivating and dynamic animation. With neon-inspired styling and smooth physics-based motion, TextFall combines playful text animation with artistic flair, making it perfect for creative displays, playful messaging, or simply having fun with words¬†in¬†motion.
